This is a small android project I'm doing to learn the basics of the SDK.

While building circuits I sometimes felt lazy and would just google what resistor colours to use for a specific resistance. However all the ones I found lets you select colours then tells you the resistance.

This application will aim to do the reverse and provide the user with the resistor band colours given a resistance and tolerance.
